    <br>Historically Shoe SoFly provided that extra shoe experience to all our SOFLY shoppers. The rise of the internet and subsequently technology based tools allowed us to think on how we could  enhance and upgrade our SoFly customers experience.</br>
    <br>Our journey started with a single webpage to provide customers with daily and weekly updates. We allowed customers to sign up for our monthly email newsletter: <strong><u>SoFly: What is up in the Shoeverse!</u></strong> Our success with our single webpage drove us to our present look.</br>

    <br>We decided our unique style spread out in a simple website serves to keep our customers connected to us anywhere and anytime. But, we want to keep the shoe shopping experience an in-store feature. So, we denied the tug to add an online buying option. Thus, we currently operate as an online shoe browser with an in-store buying twist. Here is how we operate today:</br>
    <br>
    <ol class="in">
      <li>Check out our website (Do not forget to check the Shoe SoFly Name Creator section.)</li>
      <li>Browse our weekly shoe offerings.</li>
      <li>Visit us on site and enjoy some wine as you walk it out on our runway with the shoe of your choice.</li>
      <li>Meet our Shoe SoFly Stylist to answer any of your questions.</li>
      <li>Purchase your SoFly choices.</li>
    </ol>
    </br>
  <br>You just had an online shoe appetite wetter to end with an in-store shoetastic experience.</br>

    <p><strong>Tricia</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Favorite Shoe:</strong> Flats SoFly Kind</p>
    <p>Shoe SoFly grew from the lives of four people passionate about creating a memorable shoe experience. We felt shoe shopping needed a social makeover with additions like wine, a runway, shoe experts, and other shoe shoppers. A space for Shoe SoFlyers...</p>

    <p><strong>Favorite Shoe:</strong> Play it cool</p>
    <p>Shoe SoFly started out as an idea of how to make a shoe experience better. This has grown into something more and I am having a great time doing it.</p>

    <p><strong>Lily</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Favorite Shoe:</strong> Caught my eyes</p>
    <p>The shoes caught my eye which is funny since that is the name of my favorite pair or boots. I started this because I wanted to build an experience that I felt was missing from my retail experience.</p>

    <p><strong>Tishaun</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Favorite Shoe:</strong> Walk on air</p>
    <p>Walking down the street I would see people in long lines trying to get the newest pair of shoes. I wanted to create an experience where you didn't feel like you were being rushed in and out of the store.</p>
